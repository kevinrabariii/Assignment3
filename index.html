      <dd>
        Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each
        <br />
        yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be
        opened,<br />
        and a private deck.

        <strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong>
      </p>
    </dt>
        <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down
        <br />
        quilt, comfy couch, dining table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and
        <br />
        coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot
        <br />

        <strong>What should I bring?</strong>
    </dt>
      <dd>
        Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for <br />
        changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to
        <br />
        bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
